This is just a sample project for me to try to teach myself AngularJS. There's a lot of work to be done,
but final goal is for a functional dating site (seemed like a fun idea). 


Overall goals:
[] Entire project functions as a single page Angular application.
[] Login system for site users.
[] User profiles that are able to be updated.
[] Allow users to browse through other users profiles through search features.
[] A forum for users to post.
[] Incorporate the Google Map API for distance calculations.
